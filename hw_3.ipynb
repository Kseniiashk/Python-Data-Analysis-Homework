There is a subway stop nearby (5-10 minute walk), and from there you can get to anywhere in the city. Plenty of restaurants, bars, and corner stores in the area too. Jason was friendly and an overall great host.  I highly recommend his place and I'd definitely stay there again.\"\n",

      " \"Location was very convenient: quiet street, close to a beautiful park with wonderful view of downtown Boston, and close to the subway station. The room was as advertised, quite large and with all amenities (+lots of tourist info). It's in the basement, so not a lot of light, and a bit damp+ feels like a basement= the drier was on when we arrived, plus there was a recycling bin full of empty bottles, and everything wasn't perfectly clean, but still alright all in all (and you can do laundry easily, so there's that). Free street parking on the WE. \"\n",
      " 'Dan did an extremely good job with the listing and helping us with places to go. The neighborhood was quiet but we were able to play music and did not get any noise complaints or anything.

      " 'David was a good host. The apartment is about 5 min walking to the bus station and you can get the city center in 20-30 min.\\r\\nThe best think is that you can park without problem in the same place of the apartment.\\r\\nWe will repeat.'\n",

      " 'The Carriage House was just as comfortable and charming as it appears in the photos. I had a wonderful stay in this fully furnished studio. Sarah was very flexible with my ever changing travel plans and even welcomed me with a bottle of wine and snacks in the fridge. I would definitely stay here again. '\n",
      " 'Sean was accommodating to an early check-in, which was much appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoom was definitely in the \"Cozy\" category, which I suppose was to be expected given the neighborhood and the price of the room.

My sister and I absolutely recommend to stay at Victoria’s and Tim’s house in Boston. The neighborhood was beautiful, though a bit outside the city.  But the metro station isn’t far to walk too. I definitely would come back  :-)'\n",
      " \"The first 2 days, no one else had booked the adjacent room so it was very quiet and peaceful. The host had left instructions in the bedroom for house rules, wifi information, helpful traveling apps, and checkout information as well. The bedroom was very comfortable, I didn't use the kitchen much, but it is well stocked with whatever cutlery you might need. The shared bathroom had everything labeled so that I knew where to put things (and not to get confused with R1's things). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most convenient part was the 2 minute walk to the T since I spent most of my time in downtown Boston. Even on the nights that I returned to the house later, there seemed to be a decent amount of people around that I didn't feel unsafe. It took me about an average of 20 minutes to get into downtown Boston. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the host warned, the walls are thin, so when the adjacent room was occupied, it definitely changes the experience a bit, but it's really not a big deal if you're looking for a comfortable, convenient, and private place to stay while in Boston. \"\n",

The apartment was exactly as advertised in the listing, clean, comfortable, and in a great, central location.

It is VERY convenient to public transportation to the center of Boston by subway or bus, VERY convenient to the main commercial vein of Jamaica Plain with its interesting restaurants and shops(on which you will get great advice from the hostess). If you love gardens, oh my, imagine a country garden in the middle of JP. I brought home extra Zucchini after the house refrigerator could not hold all of them any more. The hostess and her significant other are lovely, intelligent, warm, creative people. \\r\\nYou really cant go wrong with this Air BnB. \\r\\n'\n",
      " 'This place was absolutely amazing! Chris was very friendly and welcoming! The room was spacious, the bed was comfortable and it led to a patio that was lit at night! The best part of staying here was the conversations over a DELICIOUS breakfast with Chris and cuddling with her cat, Mocha Jo. Chris also went out of her way to give us suggestions for dinner places and helped us get there! Furthermore, she had subway routes and bus schedules to make sure we could get around.  We would highly recommend this place to anyone!'\n",

The room was perfect: quiet, clean and a short walk from the T (not far, but probably wouldn't recommend a rolling bag).  John was very responsive & communicative--he is a true asset to the Airbnb community.\"\n",

Once there, any question I had was answered easily in the house manual or by email from the host. This is a perfect spot to explore the south end with it's many restaurants, shops and historic beauty. It was always a pleasure to return at the end of our day out enjoy Boston. We especially enjoyed the roof deck. It is a very comfortable and relaxing space. I would 100% recommend this to my friends and family. \"\n",

      " \"Tiffany's apartment space is the perfect spot if you're staying in Boston. The location is so convenient and the apartment itself is very nice.  The loft bed is cozy and fun, it makes it seem like you are glamor camping when up in the loft.  The rest of the apartment is perfectly set up, very clean, and stocked with essentials should you need a drink or a snack or a map.  It's easy to see this space is very well cared for and that the host puts a lot of effort into making sure guests have everything they need.  For my husband and I it was a very brief stay, but should we find ourselves in Boston again we would definitely stay here again.\"\n",
      " \"Tiffany's place was perfect for a short stay in Boston.  The location is fantastic for exploring the Commons, theater district, and the freedom trail. The place itself is super tiny so it's  probably best for couples or solo travelers. Tiffany was fast to respond to all of my questions. \"\n",
      " \"Staying in Jason's apartment was a really great experience, especially since it was my first Airbnb booking. Jason provided timely information on how to access the keys to the apartment and where I could find everything that I needed (towels, washcloths, room location, refreshments, etc.). Unfortunately, Jason's schedule and my itinerary never actually crossed, so we did not get the chance to meet, however he always responded quickly if I needed to get in touch with him.\\r\\nThe room itself was clean and there was a window AC unit that really did a great job keeping the room cool. Which, now that I think about it, I think I forgot to turn off when I left. Sorry, Jason! The bathroom was also very clean and had everything I needed.\\r\\nAs one other reviewer had mentioned, I did end up having to share the bathroom with a couple that booked the other room, but it really was no issue whatsoever.\\r\\nOverall, I would highly recommend booking with Jason on your trip to Boston. His apartment is incredibly accessible to just about anything you want to do or where you want to go, he has a very nice and clean apartment and, despite not actually meeting him, was a very gracious host. \\r\\n**Please note that my not meeting Jason was very much on my end and not his. My itinerary had me leaving early and coming back very late. In light of that, he was still very accommodating and kept in touch with me.**\"\n",

Walking distance to shops, restaurants, Copley Plaza, Public Gardens etc..\\r\\nThe apartment itself has had a very recent update including rain shower, granite counters, stainless appliances and more. We loved it. Private entrance leading right out to the street which made things very easy when checking in and getting around. Thats the good. Next, the bad :/\\r\\nWhen we arrived there was a bag of linens sitting outside the door. We thought maybe the cleaners were running late and we were about 15 mins early for check-in so we waited to see if they might show up. It was hot so after a few mins, we entered the apartment to find the bed not made, dirty sheets from the previous visitor. Towels left on the floor outside the bathroom. Trash in all receptacles. More towels inside the bathroom. Dishes in the sink. Gross.\\r\\nWe ended up changing the bed ourselves, restocking the bathroom. Should I continue? Murphy bed with the worlds worst mattress, bouncy, uneven. We slept horribly. I would not stay again. In fact, Im wording if ill use Air BnB again either. Very disappointed '\n",

It was near to the prudential train station as well, which made transportation a breeze. The apartment itself was very clean and well kept. It was more than enough space for three people to sleep comfortably. The space was tastefully decorated and we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay here. Elizabeth was well-organised and ensured we had everything we needed for our trip. She gives you the independence to explore Boston at your own pace but is ready with recommendations if needed.'\n",

The room was clean and spacious, a perfect blend of luxury and character.  The bed was very comfortable.  We loved the large bathroom, the shower was large and had lots of hot water.  We ended up staying an extra night, and Jonathan had a separate room on the ground floor of the house that he moved us in to accommodate us.  It was also very comfortable and private, and had all the deluxe amenities.  Despite not having a kitchen, Jonathan complimented the room with a small fridge, and other amenities like cereal and water.  \\r\\nThe area was a great location and was a quick and cheap UBER ride to downtown.  We didn't utilize the local transit, but understand it was very close, and easy to use.  \\r\\nJonathan has several other people staying in his home, from around the world, and we loved meeting them.  Jonathan made a communal meal for everyone on the last night we were there, and it was delicious.  This just isn't an experience you can get in a hotel.  I have to say that the evening dinner was my favourite part of our trip to Boston, even after spending time in the city.  The home and family type environment we experienced was something that will stay with us forever.  \\r\\nI would recommend Jonathan and his home to anyone looking for a place to stay when visiting to Boston.  If you haven't yet decided where to stay, just do yourself a favour and hit the button to request to stay here, cause it's totally worth it.  We loved it, and you will too!!!  We will definitely be back, as we felt we came by ourselves, and left with a group of new friends.  \"\n",

When I booked, there were misrepresenting stock photos up, not the real apartment. He sent real photos only after my plane landed in Boston. A few days before the trip, he raised the price since my time there was inconvenient for him. The description was also flawed. The space is a run down studio about 15-20 minutes from downtown Boston on public transportation. The building is a mess. There\\'s graffiti on the wall of the elevator that says, \"Fix this fucking building,\" and posters asking if residents are having trouble with mice. Neighborhood seems a little seedy, but off beat if that\\'s what you like. Definitely overpriced for the quality.

Furnishings and bedding are quite comfortable and the apartment is inviting. The kitchen is modern and very well equipped; the dining area is spacious.  Beverly was so kind as to ask us what she could bring in for us for our first day breakfast which was a very nice touch.  Even though the brownstone was built in the 1800's, there were no problems the entire month of our stay.  Beverly contacted us to check to see how things were going after a few days and made us feel very comfortable.  I highly recommend this property.
